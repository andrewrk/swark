swark - a small, powerful language that compiles to DCPU-16 assembly.

Inspired by go, coffee-script, and python.

To set up dependencies:

    cd swark
    sudo npm link

To build:

    cake build
    cake build:parser

To run the tests:

    ./bin/test

To run a dcpu16 assembly program with stdio support:

    ./bin/dcpu16exec program.dasm

    Read/write characters from memory address 0x8fff to access stdio.

    Write the return code to memory address 0x8ffe to stop the program.


Technical info that should find a home in a different document someday:

    Calling convention is to push each argument in order and then jump with jsr
    which will push the return address as the final item on the stack.
    All registers may be mangled by callers, so callees should save any
    important data to the stack before calling subroutines.
