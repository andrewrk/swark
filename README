swark - a small, powerful language that compiles to DCPU-16 assembly.

Inspired by go, coffee-script, and python.

To set up dependencies:

    cd swark
    sudo npm link

To build:

    cake build
    cake build:parser

To run the tests:

    ./bin/test

To run a dcpu16 assembly program with stdio support:

    ./bin/dcpu16exec program.dcpu16.asm

    Read/write characters from memory address 0x8fff to access stdio.

    Write anything to memory address 0x8ffe to stop the program.
